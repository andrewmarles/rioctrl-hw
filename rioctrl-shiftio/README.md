This module provides the following IOs:
* 16 opto-isolated digital outputs (PNP, external voltage input 5-24V in two groups). Each output is capable of sourcing ~0.6A of current and has over-current protection.
* 16 opto-isolated digital inputs (12-24V, both sourcing and sinking connections are possible).

Due to slot width limitations, each group of outputs (4 in total) are fitted with spring-type pluggable terminal blocks (LCSC part number:
